# Gopher.community

Welcome to the main repository for the [gopher.community][gc] website! The goal
of this project is to provide an index of all the awesome activities happening
all around the world related to the Go programming language. It should also
offer a starting point in as many languages as possible for anyone who wants to
get to know the language.

Currently, the site is mostly empty but we are looking for suggestions what
content should be included here! So, if you have an idea, please take a look at
the [issue tracker][issues] and create a new ticket or comment to an existing
one!

For now, make sure to check the following ressources:

* [NonEnglish on golang.org](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/NonEnglish)
* [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/)
* [#go-nuts on freenode](irc://freenode.net/#go-nuts)
* [go-nuts mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts)

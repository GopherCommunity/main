Welcome! The goal of this site is to give you an overview of all the awesome
things that are going on inside the Go community all around the world. We are
currently looking for ideas about what types of content should be included and
how. If you want to help, please take a look at our [project on
Github](https://github.com/GopherCommunity/main).
